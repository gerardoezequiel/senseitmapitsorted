## The Problem:

### Da Nang's rapid urbanisation puts it at increased risk of flooding

**Development in lowland areas is a key concern** - `r Citep(myBib, "huongAnalysisUrbanExpansion")`

**Floods of all kinds caused £83m in damage from 1998-2020**

---
## Social Impacts

- **Increased Vulnerability:** Lowland communities, often poorer, face heightened flood risks, impacting economic well-being and increasing indebtedness.

- **Education Disruption:** Annual floods lead to school closures, affecting over 200,000 children with long-term absences impacting education, especially in specific wards.

- **Community Cohesion:** Despite challenges, community cohesion reportedly increases post-disasters.

- **Fatalities and Displacement:** Flooding has led to fatalities and significant displacement, with thousands evacuated and schools closed affecting hundreds of thousands of children.

---

## Economic Impacts

.pull-left[

**Income Reduction:**
Households, especially in certain wards, experience up to a 50% decrease in income post-flooding.

**Increased Borrowing:**
Affected households often resort to borrowing, with a significant percentage taking loans from relatives or credit institutions. 

**Infrastructure Damage:**
Flooding has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including crops, power stations, and houses, leading to substantial economic losses estimated in millions of dollars.

## Environmental Impacts

**Water Quality Deterioration:** Post-flood water quality changes adversely affect community health, with a notable percentage of households experiencing poorer water supply quality.

**Waste Management Challenges:** A significant number of households report environmental concerns due to flood-related household waste issues.

**Health Risks:** Communities face increased health risks due to polluted environments and limited access to safe drinking water, leading to diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and dengue.

# Objectives

- **Assess Impact**: Evaluate how urban expansion has affected flood vulnerability in Da Nang over the last 20 years using remote sensing.

- **Identify Risks**: Pinpoint current areas at high flood risk due to urban growth.

- **Forecast Future Risks**: Project future urban expansion patterns and their potential impact on flood vulnerability.

- **Develop Strategies**: Recommend measures for mitigation and resilience against future flood risks.

# Flood Risk Assessment

# Flood Risk Assessment

**Model to predict future extent of flooding**

.pull-left[
A Random Forest pixel-based model will be built, taking as inputs:
- DEM data (flow accumulation),
- NDBI (impervious surfaces),
- Topographic Wetness Index (TWI),
- RGB bands, or a composite of other bands calculated e.g. using PCA `r Citep(myBib, "munawar2022remote")`

**Model Deployment**

The model could be deployed before the next expected flood event in the rainy season, to examine if the change in urban expansion will impact which areas are most likely to flood. This could inform appropriate precautionary measures the local government can take.

## Land Use / Expansion Analysis

.pull-left[

### Methodology
.body-small[
1. Calculate the area of urban built up area using classification of land use from earth observation imagery
2. Calculate the required spread (km<sup>2</sup>) of urban area, using the population prediction as the independent variable
3. Calculate the predicted spread of urban area for various scenarios, including
  - no intervention (cellular automata model of urban sprawl)
  - current masterplan intervention (building up areas designated by planning constraints)
]
]

.pull-right[

### Master Planning

Da Nang Master Plan maps major development plans to be completed by 2030. Areas that will actually be built up can be determined from the projected area for each year.

#### Outcomes

- Quantity of land area required for urban expansion
- Areas prone to flood risk


#### Policies

**Future expansion of urban areas** should take place in safer areas or areas with improved flood barriers

**Current urban areas prone to floods** should

- consider relocating to a safer area
- implement flood protective measures to mitigate damage

# Project Risks & Limitations

* Budget Risks: High or unforseen costs of acquiring and processing advanced remotely sensed data

* Stakeholder Engagement Risks: Potential resistance from stakeholders due to potential displacement or poorly articulated project benefits.

* Data Accuracy Limitations: Variability in data accuracy and resolution can lead to under or overestimation of flood risk zones.

* Ongoing Maintenance: The need for continuous updates and maintenance of the flood risk map to reflect changes in land use, climate and urban development.

---
# Mitigation Actions

* Budget Mitigations: Secure funding through a diversity of actors: government grants, partnerships with NGOs and collaborations with research institutions

* Stakeholder Mitigations: Develop stakeholder engagement plan, including workshops and transparent communication, to ensure buy-in and support

* Data Accuracy Mitigations: Utilise a combination of data sources and validation to enhance the accuracy and reliability

* Ongoing Maintenance: Develop a sustainable funding model and operational plan that includes periodic review and updates
